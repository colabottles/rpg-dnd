Hi.

You have stumbled upon this blog post because you clicked a link I shared on socials and now you may be wondering, &quot;Is this the right group for me?&quot; Well, I hope we both can answer that question with a resounding, &quot;yes&excl;&quot; and agree that it is&excl;

First off, this is a diverse group of people. We do not exclude, we include. It does not matter who you are, what you identify as, where you come from. None of that. We are a group of human beings who respect each other and love to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Period.

Second. Should you want to pursue this further and claim a seat at the table, I'd like to start us off with a 15 minute video chat so you know how I run my games and so I know what you expect from the DM and the group. There has got to be a level of trust and comfort as I take safety and wellbeing seriously.

Third, should the video chat go well, then I will have you fill out a copy of our Lines &amp; Veils spreadsheet anonymously so I have an idea what to include, and what not to include. This table is a welcoming table to all and I want my players to feel safe and have fun.

From there, if everything still looks good and feels good for both parties, then we will get you into the game somehow and get playing!

To start the process, you can contact me, Todd, at @toddl.dev on Bluesky and <colabottles@notacult.social> on Mastodon

Well met and thanks for reading!

Todd
