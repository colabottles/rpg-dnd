## Backstory

**Lukor "Little Trouble" Seaweed** Lokur grew up in the sprawling underwater city of Olathoë, nestled in the heart of Greyhawk's expansive oceanic realms. Unlike the other sea elves, who gracefully navigated the complexities of aquatic court life, Lokur always felt out of place. Her tomboyish nature made her prefer the company of shipwrecks and hidden caves over opulent palaces. Her peers would dance in elegant water ballets, while she'd shyly observe from the shadows, her heart longing to join but her social awkwardness keeping her at bay.

The sea's vastness mirrored the vastness of her isolation, but it also hid her secret: a latent power inherited from her ancestors, dormant and waiting. On her eighteenth birthday, while exploring an ancient ruin, she inadvertently triggered her abilities, creating a whirlpool so intense it alarmed the guardians of Olathoë.

Now, with whispers of her power spreading, Lokur faces a new challenge: harnessing her newfound abilities and finding her place amongst her people. And perhaps, just perhaps, this socially awkward sea elf would find her true calling, bridging the gap between her heritage and her destiny.
