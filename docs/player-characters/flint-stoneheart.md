## Backstory

Flint comes from a clan of stone craftsmen (stone cutters, sculptures, etc.) in the hills outside the Vesve forest. When he was but a child of 20, their home was besieged by a band of roving hill giants. The clan was exiled from their home, and became refugees in a town of mostly wood elves (also halflings and humans) in the western part of Vesve.

This had a profound effect on Flint. First he has had a life long hatred of giants ever since and his goal in this world is to get revenge on all giants. Second, he unlike most of his kind, loves elves and the open air. His friends growing up were elves, humans, and halflings, and he looked to the rangers and druids that were the leaders of his new home as role models.

His clan became wood craftsmen in exile, but Flint at the age of 50 decided that being a ranger was the life for him. He was not ostracized from his clan, because in exile they had to learn to adapt, but he has not returned home in a long time. He has been going from one adventure to another lately, and tends to make friends fast so long as there is the possibility of hunting giants.

He will always choose gems over gold, for fear of gold fever. Currently he also has the most epic beard after finding a Belt of Dwarvenkind. Since he is already a dwarf the belt doesn't give him much else, and he would trade it for the right magical item.
