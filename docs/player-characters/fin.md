## Backstory

_7’9 · 284lbs · 72 years old_

Fin is tall with an athletic build.

He has a shortish beard, kept relatively neat for a sailor. His hair is pulled back into a man bun, and he carries a small wooden lyre made from tree branches and glittering spider web silk. Animals seem attracted to him when he plays it.

Fin has tattoos on his hands and arms, including a giant octopus on his right forearm, and a black cat on his left (both magical). He wears a white linen shirt, unbuttoned halfway, sleeves rolled up, fitted khaki capri pants, and no shoes.

He wears a hagstone necklace, taken from the shores of his home, that serves as a druidic focus. His staff changes appearance with the seasons, and his shield is made from an old piece of driftwood. He carries his few possessions in a messenger bag.
