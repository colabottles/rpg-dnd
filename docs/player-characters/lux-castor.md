# Lux Castor

## Character Details

**Player:** Ben M.

**Race:** Half-Elf

**Class:** Wild Magic Sorcerer

## Backstory

**Alluxian "Lux" Castor** comes from a family steeped in nobility, though he now travels the world. He's a proud practitioner of the magic arts. What he neglects to mention in his prideful boasts, however, is this his magic can be, uhâ€¦ *unpredictable* at times. When he brags about that time he spent eight minutes as a construct of pure light, he won't mention that it was purely an accident. Likewise, he won't tell you at all about the time he spent several days as a frog and had to be helped out.
