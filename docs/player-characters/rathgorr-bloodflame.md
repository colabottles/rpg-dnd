**Player:** Brian

**Race:** Dragonborn

**Class:** Paladin

## Backstory

Rathgorr Bloodflame is an imposing figure, standing nearly seven and a half feet tall, with a muscular frame that exudes raw power. His crimson scales shimmer with a faint sheen, like embers flickering beneath the surface. Black horns curl back from his skull, sharp and menacing, framing a fearsome visage marked by burning amber eyes that seem to pierce into a person's soul. His snout is adorned with small ridges, and his sharp teeth gleam when he speaks or snarls.

Rathgorr’s armor is as intimidating as his form—jagged, blackened plate etched with infernal runes. His cloak, a tattered crimson, flutters like flames in the wind. He wields a massive, blackened greatsword with a serrated edge, its blade faintly glowing with an ominous red hue. Across his chest is a brand shaped like a claw, a mark of his rejection of his former oath.

Rathgorr was not always the embodiment of wrath and fire that he is today. He was once Aurion Dawnflame, a noble gold Dragonborn paladin devoted to Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. Aurion epitomized the ideals of justice, honor, and selflessness, wielding his golden greatsword in service of the weak and oppressed.

### The Fall from Grace

Aurion’s journey toward darkness began with tragedy. He served as the protector of a remote mountain village, nestled in the shadow of a sacred temple to Bahamut. For years, he defended the villagers with unwavering resolve, becoming a symbol of hope. One fateful day, a cult of Tiamat, the Crimson Fang, launched a devastating attack on the village. Though Aurion fought valiantly, he was outnumbered and overwhelmed.

In his desperation, Aurion begged Bahamut for intervention. His prayers went unanswered, and the cult slaughtered the villagers. When the dust settled, Aurion stood alone amidst the ruins, clutching the lifeless body of a child who had once looked to him as a hero. The experience shattered him.

Wracked with grief and anger, Aurion began to question the worth of his faith. Why had Bahamut forsaken him and the innocents he had sworn to protect? Doubt turned to bitterness, and bitterness to rage. Aurion declared his oaths hollow, rejecting Bahamut and renouncing the ideals he had once cherished.

### The Pact with Tiamat

Word of Aurion’s disillusionment reached the Crimson Fang. Seeing an opportunity, they sent emissaries to offer him a chance at vengeance and power. Tiamat’s highest cleric, a sinister figure known only as Maldrak the Ebonfang, approached Aurion personally. Maldrak promised him strength beyond imagining and a purpose free of the burdens of morality. Aurion, consumed by his fury and desire for retribution, swore allegiance to Tiamat.

As a reward for his fealty, Maldrak performed a dark ritual. The cleric invoked Tiamat’s power to transform Aurion’s very essence. His radiant gold scales burned away, replaced by crimson red. His eyes, once glowing with divine light, now burned with infernal fire. The transformation was excruciating, a symbolic rebirth into Tiamat’s service. When it was complete, Aurion was no more. Rathgorr Bloodflame rose in his place—a living weapon of destruction.

### A New Purpose

As a red Dragonborn, Rathgorr became one of the Crimson Fang’s most fearsome champions. With his new identity came a twisted sense of purpose: to destroy those who clung to the ideals of justice and order he once upheld. Rathgorr now leads raids against temples of Bahamut, relishing the destruction of his former faith.
