# Chapter 1: Game 25

### For Whom The Horn Tolls

The party managed to stuff Molly into the Bag of Holding and proceed along precariously through the chambers. The trees claimed the life of Teldroll as he first grabbed one apple, then tried again at another tree and just vanished, or more was engulfed in blue flames and turned to a pile of dust.

Everyone remaining in the party took an apple and was granted either a point of Charisma or Constitution. Vidya decided to press her luck and got a whammy in that she gained a point of Charisma, but taking a second fruit from the purple tree she lost a point of Constitution.

The group dispatched a shadow demon that had been lurking in the chambers for a millennia. It did put up a bit of a fight but in the end, Mara dealt the final blow. They found a wand of light which proved to be less than handy for being down in the darkness as they were, but it was a magic item nonetheless.

The group moved to the final chamber where The Black Cyst was held. Writhing and pulsating on a large stone block as the party eventually thought their way to discovering how to use the horn and incense, they managed to open a secret door and find two chests filled with incense and some odd parts where they unlocked another secret spot where there laid some interesting items.

Now what to do with those items?
