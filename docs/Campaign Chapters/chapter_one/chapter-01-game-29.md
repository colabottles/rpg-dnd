### Bright Lights, The Free City (of Greyhawk)

After finally getting the sword out of the ice wall using some rather (and many interesting) techniques. The party finally were able to wrestle the sword out of the wall. But there was only one problem... the whispers. Faint, soft, unintelligble whispers. So when Mikylos finally picked up the sword, the voices grew stronger, trying to feed into Mikylos.

As soon as things seemed liek they were about to get weird all up in the icy keep, a bright lights flashed and a figure enveloped in that blinding, white light appeared. This was the avatar of Velnius. Now the sword, wasn't your run-of-the-mill, average sword. Nope. It was a beautiful, ancient sword, filled with power beyond comprehension. The only problem was its sentience. Or at least, how it liked to take control of people to do its bidding.

Velnius was able to take the sword with relative ease from Mikylos, something that was necessary because this sword was the sword Thaizdun was trying to obtain. The problem being, the creatures that were 'employed' at the Temple of Tharizdun weren't the brightest bunch of assistants and never realized the sword had been taken to Thunderclap Keep many centuries earlier.

The creatures may have been able to figure that out by going down to the level where The Black Cyst resided, yet they were too afraid to go to the lower levels of the Temple, fearing The Black Cyst.

As Velnius acquired the sword, Icingdeath from Mikylos a calm and serenity washed over the party and everyone knew things would be alright. Seeing how the group probably didn't know how to get out of the Keep and back to civilization, Velnius teleported the group back to Gnome Vale where Laird Gwaylar and the gnome community awaited the party.

After much celebration and rejoicing (think Ewok part after Return of the Jedi but with a bunch of gnomes) the group was informed by Gwaylar they needed to seek out a gnome who had previuously gone after the sword, Renton Lembos. Owner and proprietor (reluctantly) of The Frozen Scimitar Inn.

After getting to the Free City of Greyhawk where Lembos resides, the party was greeted and mysteriously their rooms were all paid for by an unknown benefactor. After retiring to their rooms, each party member had the same note, in the same writing on their pillow:

> I am always a step ahead. I am always watching.
>
> - C

What this means, is anyones guess, but what awaits the group as they move on to the second chapter?
