# Chapter 1: Game 27

## 24 August 2024

### Reunited, and It Feels So Good

After dispatching of the piercers, the group wandered for a bit before going into the rooms where there were some sort of barriers, frozen mists and such. The kind of thing smart adventurers just don't walk through without forethought.

As the group backtracked to the eastern side of the Keep, they stumbled upon a cranky ice troll guard. After dispatching of said guard, they moved onward to discover another guard, but this guard was different.

Skrag was an ice troll, make no mistake, but Skrag was tired of sitting around bored and watching a couple of adventurers frozen in ice. Skrag was a union ice troll and missed his family. So the group convinced Skrag to just take off and let them "watch the area" so-to-speak.

Once Skrag was gone, the group checked out the area and found Eritrea and Squeak, encased in ice. Taken captive by the denizens of the Temple of Tharizdun, they were brought to Thunderclap Keep and handed over to the ice trolls as a sacrifice to The Chained God, Tharizdun.

Now, reunited with the party, the group was once again strong and ready to discover what was next!
