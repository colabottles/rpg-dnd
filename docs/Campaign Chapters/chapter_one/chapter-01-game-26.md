# Chapter 1: Game 26

## 10 August 2024

### Ice, Ice Baby

After figuring out the necessary parts to place into the floor, the group dispatches the Black Cyst and finds some interesting items that may be beneficial later on as they go on. The group collectively figure out the puzzle and while dispatching the Black Cyst, they also picked up a few strange items (a wand, a cube, and some gems).

When deciding on their next move a brilliant light flashed before them and they found themselves outside of Thunderclap Keep up in the frozen area in the Land of Black Ice. Vidya spotted an entrance so they all went in and started exploring the area.

While not as cold as the cold they felt in the Temple of Tharizdun, the group were surrounded by hundreds of dead, frozen, lifeless bodies, encased in ice. The entrance to the Keep had an oddly-shaped foyer and as the group split up to check out a couple of different areas, Molly and Mikylos spotted an ice troll patrolling part of the area to the east.

Deciding that engaging an ice troll at this point was not feasible, Molly and Mikylos made haste back to the group as the rest of them went into the common hall, which is lined with some of the tallest bookshelves and thousands of books encased in frost and ice.

That's when Flint discovered that three piercers wanted to join the party and see who the newest visitors were.
