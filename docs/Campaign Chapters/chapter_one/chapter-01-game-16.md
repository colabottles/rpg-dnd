# Chapter 1: Game 16

## 6 January 2024

### The Temple of Tharizdun

Some of the party are mysteriously rendered sick and have stayed back at camp while Molly, Flint, and Mara trudge on. As they get to the Temple, they check out the exterior and cannot get into the temple via the lower level due to it being blocked off, so they make their way around to the back of the Temple where a set of stairs on each side go up to the upper level where the entrance is in the back.

After charming a couple norkers, Molly gets the party entrance, but to a room filled with norkers and gnolls. The ensuing battle finds the party overpowering the norkers and gnolls after much fight. They also are able to meet with the newest member of the group, Vidya. They are held captive by the monsters, but they manage to free themselves and join the battle to help the group.

The party then combs the massive room for treasure where Molly finds a Quaal's Feather Token and a greasy pillow cover. Some other coins are found by some of the group as well.

The only way down to the lower levels are a set of stairs separated by a wall. The party then stops to rest for awhile.
