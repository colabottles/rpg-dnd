# Chapter 1: Game 22

### Down to the Dungeon

The group found itself heading back to the deep chute that led down to the dungeon level of the Temple, battling the annis hags and searching rooms. Finally getting to the shaft leading down to the dungeon level, the group learned that the horn would show them the way.

Getting into the dungeon level posed a little issue for the party as they had to answer the question, but eventually, the group figured it out to bypass the four multi-colored idols outside the shaft they came down.

Now the group stands in the dungeon.

The group moves cautiously down the worn steps of dark grey stone. The flight continues straight for some distance. the group counts over 100 steps before the group notices that the walls are again of black rock, polished basalt. Another 20' or so and the group is standing in a large chamber, all of ebon-hued rock, save a great square column of darkest purple in the center of the area.

This appears to be some sort of formal processional way. There are 20' wide passages leading east and west, another north, the latter having several pillars down the center. This 40' square chamber is high-vaulted, for the central column mass rises about 40' to meet the ceiling above in arches of stone. There are two doors giving onto this place, one on the other side of the north passageway leading from the chamber. What catches the groups attention, however, is the purple column. It bears some sort of statue, in a niche, as it is of deepest black.

Four idols are in the center of each side of the great square column of dark purple. Red, green, blue, and black. Each are 10 feet tall and depict different dressed human(oid) figures. It is cold in this level, very cold.

The four idols are described as follows:

1. BLACK IDOL: This stone figure is about 10' tall. It is man-shaped and depicted wearing armor of strange design. The plates are fluted, runneled, and winged. The mail showing beneath is triangular. Some form of cape drapes the shoulders, scalloped edges hanging to the figures knees. The hands clasp a huge, wavy-edged sword. The helm, like the armor,bears many strange projections and spiky ridges. Oddest of all, its helmet face shows no openings.

2. GREEN IDOL: On the east face of the square column is another 10' tall figure, but instead of black stone, this idol is of deep, dark green. The form appears swathed in a flowing gown from feet to neck, but it is obviously male (if human at all) because of its broad chest and shoulders. The long sleeves of the garment cover the hands. A high collar stands from cheek to cheek, and a tight cap covers the head. What is obviously a mask covers the face, for what reason is unknown. The mask, however, is craggy and seamed, imitating an old man perhaps. A staff leans against the right shoulder.

3. RED IDOL: This statue on the north face of the column is of intense carmine shade, dark but somehow intensely red nonetheless. The apparel depicted is: high boots and hose, doublet-like garment, and gauntlets. All of these items seem foreign in make, familiar but strange. The head is covered by a long hood, drawn tight round the face so as to show only an indefinable oval. An axe-like weapon with shortish handle, long blade with many angles, and top spike is set butt upwards before the idol, the gauntleted hands of the 10' high figure resting easily atop the haft.

4. BLUE IDOL: On the west face of the pillar is yet another huge statue, 10' tall, all of deep indigo hue. The form is robed in a many-pleated garment. The girdle depicted is ornately carved with signs and sigils which are unknown to any of you. A broad cowl covers the head and projects well beyond the face, so that it is hidden in shadow. Illumination reveals only blank, blue stone. The arms of the idol are held across the body to meet just below the chest, the folds of robe hiding all, even the hands; but where they must meet projects a strange device, possibly a sceptre with a convoluted end and many filigreed (decorated with ornamental openwork of delicate or intricate design) sections.
