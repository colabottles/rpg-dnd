### Mephits and Remorhaz and Ice, Oh My!

After rescuing Eritrea and Squeak from their icy prisons, the group proceeeded to move along and open the way to the ice mephits which Mikylos char-broiled in an instant with a fireball spell, leaving one remaining that Flint dispatched before moving onward.

Figuring out some of the puzzles before them the reached the chamber where in lied a sword stuck into the frozen wall of the keep, but they had to get past the remorhaz first. After the loing battle, which concluded with Mara taking out the remorhaz, the group set their sights on the sword. Well, everyone except for Molly. Molly doesn't seem to trust random swords lying aorund.

Now the question remains.
