# Chapter 2: Game 14

## What Lurks in the Shadows?

### 26 April 2025

After being led back to the hole that the group passed last session, the group backtracked to find two trapped chests, very large chests, in this rough-hewn closet of sorts to find a note leading them to the northeastern part of the castle on this level.

After much trepidation, the group went down into the third level and pushed forward. The sounds that they heard upstairs, becoming more and more vocal and louder. Not being able to pinpoint the source of the noises, the group stumbled upon a closet in the newly formed third level of the castle.

Flint knows that this part of the castle has just been built, probably a dozen years or so old. What could be building down here? The party would have to fight a group of eight colchiln before they could move on. The colchiln put up somewhat of a fight, but the group of adventurers emerged victorious.

What else lurks in the shadows of this deep level of the castle?
