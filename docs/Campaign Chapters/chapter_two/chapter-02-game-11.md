# Chapter 2: Game 11

## Barbecue is on the Menu

### 15 March 2025

More searching from the party led them to another room filled with guards that were expeditiously dispatched by Mikylos and Rathgorr's firepower (literal fire, mind you).

After stumbling upon a pool of acid and a prison cells with the remains of three humans chained against the walls with a very strange _CY 457_ carved into the wall along with other assorted graffiti, the group found even more storage room and unoccupied rooms (great for storage and other useful applications of living space) along the way. 

After Mara led the group most of the way around this level of the castle, it was a rather light combat day but the group ended the session standing outside a room where there were voices. Whom those voices belong to, is a mystery.
