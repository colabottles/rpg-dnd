# Chapter 2: Game 13

## Single Clerics (Put A Ring On It)

### 12 April 2025

The party decided to venture forth down to the third level of the castle for a hesitant, but quick jaunt through this level and happened to stumble upon the Ring of Winter in some grand stroke of luck. They also heard noises coming from a place in the level where they could not pinpoint where those sounds were emanating from.

Mara decided to put the Ring of Winter in the Bag of Holding and off the party went back upstairs... for now.
