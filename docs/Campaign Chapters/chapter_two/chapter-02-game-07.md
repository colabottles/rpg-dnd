# Chapter 2: Game 7

## The Interns Are getting Pink-Slipped

### 18 January 2025

As the party explored many parts of the second level to the castle, they found a lot of unused space. Unused space that Mikylos probably would have a million ideas for on how to utilize that space. 

Rathgorr decided to stare into a puddle of water on the floor and see some weird purple-ish stuff, almost like an oblong stone and it was giving off this feeling that Rathgorr couldn't quite put his claw on.`

Until then, the group (without both Mikylos and Molly "dare I say... M&amp;M opr Eminem?") got around to Rathgorr and the murderess Eritrea kicking the door down to the guard quarters and going in for a donnybrook.

After dispatching the guards, the group explored further into the castle, winding through hallways and exploring rooms that were just nothing but dust and cobwebs. The group left off outside a door after they had convened after splitting up into two groups and are now just standing there, hearing muffled noises.

Is it more "interns" or is it something bigger&quest;
