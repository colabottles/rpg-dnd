# Chapter 2: Game 10

## Proceed with Caution... Maybe.

### 1 March 2025

The group, consisting of Mara, Mikylos, Rathgorr, and Flint, proceeded to find many interesting things in the wake of the defeat of the wizard in his study. A ring, which Flint put on that ended up being cursed (It's ok, he's fine), some coinage, gems, some incense that ended up knocking the characters out for a short time, a mud room that ended up being a rather large patch of brown mold (nothing a fireball couldn't handle).

Or that big room with the shadows that looked as if fighters used it for training, or maybe fighters and mages&quest;

A lot of walking and a lot of trepidation (trapped chests with gas traps, cursed items, the normal) the group stumbled upon a large, oblong, purple stone that when Rathgorr, Flint, and Mikylos became almost entranced and saw very disturbing and horrific morbid visions. CHaracters betraying the group and possibly killing the entire group, a dark foe following the party, or maybe it was that vision of an undecipherable event that may be looming that is haunting the three&quest;

As the group wandered the halls of this massive castle, they could only ask the question, &apos;What do we have to do to get a rogue in here&quest;&apos;
