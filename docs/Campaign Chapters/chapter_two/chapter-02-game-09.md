# Chapter 2: Game 9

## Who Pulled Out the Rug from under Us&quest;

### 22 February 2025

The group went on with Mara, Mikylos, and Rathgorr all exploring more of the castles second level. Only to wind up in a circular room fighting a rather maniacal wizard. As soon as the party emerged victorious, they decided to pick up the giant rug and try to get it into the Bag of Holding. Only to have the rug animate and spring to attack!

The trio went on to figure out a way to kill the rug, since magic was not affecting it as it should. Leave it up to the cleric, Mara, to find a way to  grab a candle or two off the mantle and light the rug on fire, eventually destroying it and coming out of the encounter a little more warm than they went into battle with.
