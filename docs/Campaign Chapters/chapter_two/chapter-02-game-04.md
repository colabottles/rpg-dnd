# Chapter 2: Game 4

## You Can Never Be Too Careful

### 7 December 2024

The group reconvened in the rug room where they had defeated the ancient air elemental, Aelem. Unfortunately, when Molly removed the pin from the rug, the rug became useless when once before the pin was pulled was a flying carpet! But, more was to come.

One rug was moving! When most of the party unrolled the rug, out fell out a Dragonborn named Rathgorr Bloodflame. The party and Rathgorr decided to join forces. Rathgorr's former party members were slain, and now Rathgorr wants revenge on the denizens of the castle who are responsible for this.

As the group merged and started to explore further, they came upon a great curtain and large pillars, which after some deliberation, the party (more so Eritrea) threw Squeak into the room beyond the curtain to figure out what the situation was. When Squeak returned with news that there was nothing in the way of danger, Eritrea snuck into the great area to find two bleacher-type seating structures, along with more pillars carved as humanoids and a great granite throne, with a large, hulking figure made of iron sitting upon it.

After a lot of investigating and trying to find something where they could figure out what was going on, Mara was able to procure a longsword from a statue that came to life! But not before Vidya was able to procure a dagger from a statue that was in the form of a mage-type. When Mara made the statue come to life and the figure moved ever so slightly, a cavity, below the statue uncovered a copper urn inside. Which Mikylos plucked out of the hole before the statue could move back to its resting place permanently.

More searching by the party uncovered nothing but more mystery. It was also concluded that Mikylos was very clumsy and had two left feet on this day.
