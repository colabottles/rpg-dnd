# Chapter 2: Game 2

## We Don't Make Mistakes, Just Happy Little Accidents

### 02 November 2024

The group rides forth to Maure Castle and when they get there, they take the long walk down the slope for what seems forever to the interior doors to enter the castle. Heavy double doors that will not open until Eritrea produced the Silver Key of Portals was held against the door and the doors opened.

The castle is eerily quiet and the party sends Squeak to check out the area up ahead as they decide which way to go. Squeak comes across a door with a flickering, soft light coming from under the door. As the group decides to go where Squeak investigated, they come into a circular room with four frescoes that are of a fighter, paladin type in a wilderness scene.

As the candles are blown out, the frescoes comes to life. First one, and then as the battle ended, the remaining three sre snuffed due to the movements of the characters and enemy during the fight. Triggering the other three paladin frescoes to come to life.

After a long battle, the group emerged victorious and now face the rest of the castle, looking for the Ring of Winter.
