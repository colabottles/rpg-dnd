# Chapter 2: Game 3

## Knock, Knock! Who's There?

### 23 November 2024

The group started exploring other parts of the first floor to the castle after dealing with the fighters that came from out of the frescoes in the circular room.

They navigated their way to another, smaller, circular room where 9 holes (not a golf course) were laid out in perfect distance from each other only to have Molly and Mara start throwing items they had on them down the holes.

Luckily for the two, Mikylos was not affected by whatever impulse came over Mara and Molly and forcefully escorted the pair out of the room to prevent further damage.

After some time regrouping themselves, the group then moved on to the largest room in the castle on the first floor. A silver chalice that floated above the pool ended up being an illusion of sorts. While the chalice certainly was real, the enchantment placed upon it was one where the cup changed colors every turn.

The large room with the pool of hetfish that the group stayed away from and then they started going through rooms checking each of the side rooms out until the group split into two.

One group found an old man who wa weaving items, trying to entice the group into trading for some clothes he really wanted to partake of, but, the group being of keen senses was not swayed and they ended up dispatching the old man and finding out that the items may have indeed been cursed items.

After the encounter with the old man, Molly came across a room with a few carpets in them. Molly, being ever so inquisitive, removed a gold pin from the carpet which had the word "Aelem" embroidered in gold on the carpet, which in turn released an ancient air elemental to which the party also defeated before the group called a long rest thus ending their day.

What other surprises await the group? There are more doors to be found and more possibilities behind them!
