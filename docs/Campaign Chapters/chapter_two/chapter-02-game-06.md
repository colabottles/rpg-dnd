# Chapter 2: Game 6

## Don&apos;t Go Into the Dark Caves&excl;

### 4 January 2025

The group finally made it to the stairs leading down to the second level of the castle. When they got to the second level, they were met with a volley of bronze spears coming out of the wall. After picking spears out of their armor, the group decided to wander around the area closest to the stairs.

Eritrea and Squeak decided to check out the hole in the wall that led into a rather dark and cramped cave, only to find a guard there. A giant tyrg. After Mikylos put up a wall of force, Rathgorr bounded over the wall to deal with the tyrg. Joining in the fray, Eritrea, scrambled over the wall to plunger her dagger into the skull of the tyrg, dispatching the rather large hungry, and cranky guard thus making it safe for the group to continue further on.

Just as Rathgorr stops staring into the puddle seeing purple-ish oblong shapes, maybe the group can go one some more?
