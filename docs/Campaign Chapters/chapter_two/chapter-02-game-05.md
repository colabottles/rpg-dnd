# Chapter 2: Game 5

## Heavy Metal

### 21 December 2024

Had not Rathgorr been rummaging around the golem looking for compartments or traps or things, the group may not have been aware that such activities would bring the seated monster to life, and yet here they were.

This session found the party up against a rather large and terrible iron golem. As in the usual manner of which this party operates, they found a way to take down this nasty brute who had an arsenal of tricks up its sleeve. Or metal, I suppose.

Carrying a huge crystal sword, feather whip, and acid breath that would make a trash dump blush, the party found a way to dispatch of this brute in relatively good time without death.

The DM, in all fairness, missed quite a bit of the notes and it wasn't the experience he had hoped the party would have fighting the golem. All the party members present though did a great job in taking down this brute.
