The group awoke to a young boy gathering all the members and bringing them to see Mordenkainen himself. From there, Mordenkainen offered them the chance to undertake a quest for the Ring of Winter. When the group was enticed by some platinum and a book for Vidya, they went off to do some shopping for provisions that they wanted or needed.

After shopping, the group met back with Mordenkainen after settling down and getting some much needed rest before going off to Maure Castle.

> Little is known about the true origin of the ring. Gleaned from ancient history the ring was created during the time when the countries of the Realms were little more than scattered villages. It was forged by a powerful mage, that some say was Azuth before he became a god, and was kissed by Auril, the goddess of winter.
>
> In the Year of the Screeching Vole, 163 DR, the Ring of Winter was in Cormyr, where its magic called forth an unseasonal storm of ice in the middle of summer. So tremendous were its powers that it destroyed an entire village, as well as the home of a Cormyrean nobleman. At the time, Cormanthyran elves recognized the Ring of Winter for what it was, and regretted not having stepped in to edify its wielder before the Ring had had its chance to kill and destroy
>
> Nearly 500 years after, in 650 DR, this was still the last sighting of the Ring itself on the mainland of Faerûn.
>
> Before 1362 DR, the ring had been hidden within the Temple of Ubtao in the lost city of Mezro, hidden there by the bara, Dhalmass Rayburton of Cormyr, after he had used the ring and thereby accidentally murdered several people. The former Harper, Artus Cimber, after spending years of his life searching for the ring, learned of the location of the ring and retrieved it, thereafter using it to repel a goblin invasion of Mezro.
>
> At some point after the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR, the ring was relentlessly sought after by the frost giant, Jarl Storvald, as he believed it to be a way to raise frost giants in the ordning. The Zhentarim were also looking for the ring around the same time, and Nilraun Dhaerlost informed Jarl Storvald that the ring was in the possession of Artus Cimber. The frost giants used a blod stone to locate Artus Cimber through his blood, but were instead drawn to his son Sirac in Bryn Shander. The leader of the raiding party, Drufi, then attacked the city with twelve frost giants following this incorrect lead, but their attack was thwarted by the city's inhabitants, with the help of adventurers.
>
> After their failed attack on Bryn Shander, Drufi and her fellow giants journeyed to the jungles of Chult to search for Artus Cimber there, causing much confusion among the local rulers.
>
> Around the same time, the half-elven sorceress Xandala journeyed to Port Nyanzaru in search of Cimber, seeking to wrest the ring from him. To this end, Xandala attempted to manipulate a party of adventurers by claiming to be Cimber's lost daughter.

Mordenkainen then sat back and finished the tale.

> It was said that the ring had other powers that could only be accessed by an evil being who did not fall under control of the ring. It was rumored that the ring could be used to summon white dragons, or the primordial Cryonax, and freeze entire worlds. It was said that the ring could only be destroyed if worn by the Summer Queen.
>
> It is rumored to be in the Flaeness and I want to make certain it is, or it is not. Either way, the ring must be destroyed. It can no longer exist here on Oerth, or in Faerûn. Simply put, I am counting on you adventurers because I simply have more pressing details to attend to now that you have told me about the letters you have found. I believe the Red Wizards of Thay are now involved. Who knows what they are up to, and I must find out.

With that, you all retire to your rooms, resting until daybreak to depart on Mordenkainen's fantastic adventure he has assembled you for.

> Remember, the key is your way to entry into the castle, do not lose the key, and return the key to me when you return with the ring. Do not attempt to leave with the key. I fare thee well and best of luck with you all.
