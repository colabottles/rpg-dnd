# The Campaign Setting

The setting starts in Greyhawk and the realm called Oerth. It has been a long campaign, but pieces of a puzzle have now formed and are beginning to manifest themselves to the players having some connection with each artifact they find.

First, it was Icingdeath. A long sword once thought to be lost to the ice and the myths of time. Next , the Ring of Winter. Will the group find this mysterious frosted band of gold&quest;

It is still early in the campaign, but there is so much more to come and many more twists and turns in the future!

## Looking for a Group&quest;

The Crits &amp; Giggles group is looking for a player that can commit to a bi-weekly schedule (subject to change) of games on Saturdays at 10 am Mountain Time (UTC -7) / 1 pm Eastern Time (UTC -4, UTC -5 during Eastern Standard Time) for a couple hours a weekend, every other Saturday.

It is a casual-style game played on Discord and through the Crits &amp; Giggles Discord server.

We use DnD Beyond to manage our characters and the campaign. We will however, be switching to Foundry VTT in the coming months as soon as the DM has time to learn and get everything moved over to Foundry.

For more information, please go [here and read through what we are looking for]().
