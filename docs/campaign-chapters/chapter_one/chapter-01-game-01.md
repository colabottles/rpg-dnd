# Chapter 1: Game 1

## Glowing reviews at the Squirming Octopus

### 7 January 2023

Once upon a time, in a land of fantasy and adventure, a group of brave heroes set out on a quest to save the kingdom from an ancient evil.

Fin, a brave adventurer, met a strange person who gave him a necklace. Though, Fin was disappointed as he didn't get the soup he was promised. Fin's journey continued, and he came across Molly, who was being harassed by a couple of wolves. Fin helped Molly fend off the wolves and they decided to travel together.

On their journey, Fin and Molly met Lux, a powerful sorcerer, and together they traveled to the city of Yecha. Fin had an octopus tattoo named Harold that glowed, and it was the same symbol as the sign to the tavern/inn where they met another strange person. This person told them of their purpose and how they were chosen to save the kingdom from an ancient evil.

The party learned to keep Alanaa, a wise druid, on her toes when talking so she did not drift off in a conversation. Molly put on a hell of a show at the Squirming Octopus tavern, and the proprietor was so impressed that he wants her back any time she is in town. She rocked the plaster off the walls.

However, tomorrow night's entertainment, Bumford and Sons, could not make it, so the tickets will be refunded at the door. Fin and his party have to come up with a new plan. Jolene, a local woman in the tavern, doesn't want Molly to take her man.

The party will have to face many challenges and make difficult decisions as they continue on their quest to save the kingdom. But with courage, determination, and a little bit of luck, they just might be able to defeat the ancient evil and restore peace to the land.
