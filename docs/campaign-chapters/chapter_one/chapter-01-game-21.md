# Chapter 1: Game 21

## 16 March 2024

### No Rest for the Weary

More group shenanigans, this time they met some more nasty norkers and a norker witch doctor after blowing up the area with a fireball in the last game. The group stumbled on a dwarven prisoner by the name of Teldroll Storis and he asked to go along with the group.

Storis is looking for the equipment his captors took from him and wanted to see how this group of adventurers rolled.

Molly opened a door to one room and quickly shut it after spying four ogres sitting in a room but was not seen by the clumsy bunch of oafs.
