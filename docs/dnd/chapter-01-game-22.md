# Chapter 1: Game 22

## 30 March 2024

### Down to the Dungeon

The group found itself heading back to the deep chute that led down to the dungeon level of the Temple, battling the annis hags and searching rooms. Finally getting to the shaft leading down to the dungeon level, the group learned that the horn would show them the way.

Getting into the dungeon level posed a little issue for the party as they had to answer the question, but eventually, the group figured it out to bypass the four multi-colored idols outside the shaft they came down.

Now the group stands in the dungeon.

The group moves cautiously down the worn steps of dark grey stone. The flight continues straight for some distance. the group counts over 100 steps before the group notices that the walls are again of black rock, polished basalt. Another 20' or so and the group is standing in a large chamber, all of ebon-hued rock, save a great square column of darkest purple in the center of the area.

This appears to be some sort of formal processional way. There are 20' wide passages leading east and west, another north, the latter having several pillars down the center. This 40' square chamber is high-vaulted, for the central column mass rises about 40' to meet the ceiling above in arches of stone. There are two doors giving onto this place, one on the other side of the north passageway leading from the chamber. What catches the groups attention, however, is the purple column. It bears some sort of statue, in a niche, as it is of deepest black.

Four idols are in the center of each side of the great square column of dark purple. Red, green, blue, and black. Each are 10 feet tall and depict different dressed human(oid) figures. It is cold in this level, very cold.
