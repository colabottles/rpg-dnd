# Chapter 1: Game 17

## 20 January 2024

### No Cause For Alarm

The group descended into the lower level of the temple and there were met by norker sentries who spotted the party. One norker was charmed by the effervescent Molly and then when the party tried to get the norker to show them around, do some window shopping, and more, they stumbled upon another adventurer named Mikylos who was detained by a couple of hill giants.

Mikylos was with Vidya, the other newest member of the group when they were captured. Mikylos was able to slip past the monsters and proceed to the lower level where they were caught.

The hill giants, twin brothers named Meldrag and Deldrag were watching over the prisoner when all of a sudden the group stumbled into the room only to incite a fierce battle only to have Meldrag shamed by Molly because he could not shop at Claire's.

After a long battle, the party and a hearty fireball that incinerated some of the guards, the party took to camping for the long rest they needed and were surprised by the trolls that were in the adjacent room to the west.

The alarm was still going off and to this day, no one has shut it off. Yet.
