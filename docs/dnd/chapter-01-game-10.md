# Chapter 1: Game 10

## 30 September 2023

### Norkers Everywhere

We headed out came across multiple groups of norkers and while we promptly dispatched the first group, the second group took quite a bit longer.

At the end of the day we put up camp, and Eritrea found a hamster. Molly accidentally cast speak with animals from her new lute, talked to the hamster, then accidentally cast invisibility on herself.

At the end of the day, the party all contributed to dispatching the second band of norkers and earned a well-deserved rest.

The hamster is named Squeak.
