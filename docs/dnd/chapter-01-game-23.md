# Chapter 1: Game 23

## 1 June 2024

### Do you want to get rocked?

The group of adventurers stood at the central pillar where they have stepped out of the shaft leading down from the temple level to the dungeon level. The horn was sounded and the purple figure that appeared granted the party passage (after one unsuccessful attempt) through the level.

After solving the "riddle" and dispelling the illusion, the group ventured north into the long corridor and ran across two caryatid columns on their way to meet unexpectedly, the boss, Groorg. Groorg is a Mountain Giant, or should I say _was_ a Mountain Giant.

The group, after a long battle, settled in and long rested. WIll the group carry on and explore the rest of the level they currently reside in? Will the group finally solve the mystery of the temple?

Who knows what more the Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun holds for these mighty adventurers!
