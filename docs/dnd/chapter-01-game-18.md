# Chapter 1: Game 18

## 27 January 2024

### Trolling for Trolls

The group fought on with the strengths of many women. One troll left his buddies in the dust and just disappeared, two trolls suffered a fate that included crispy skin.

With a contribution from everyone, the trolls were defeated and Mara and Vidya reaped some reward. Etchings were found in one corner of the room where it appears there is a secret door there... somewhere... Arrows pointing inward and upward and then a crudely scrawled stick figure with hands stretched outward in a pushing motion. Hmmm...

The alarm is still going off... still.
