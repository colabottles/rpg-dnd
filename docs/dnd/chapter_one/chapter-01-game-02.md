# Chapter 1: Game 2

## All that shimmers is not gold?

## 21 January 2023

Lux, the powerful sorcerer, ventured downstairs in the Squirming Octopus tavern and met Lokur, a mysterious stranger. Lokur and Lux quickly hit it off and decided to confer with the rest of the group to join them in their quest.

As Lux made his way back upstairs, he ran into Alanaa again. She gave him a card with the symbol of a cloud with a bird perched upon top of it. Lux was intrigued by the symbol, but he didn't have much time to ponder it as the room they were previously in was now different, changed by some sort of magical means.

As they explored the room, they found a robe and feather that had the same symbol as the card given to Lux by Alanaa. They were stumped as to how this room had been transformed by magical means and by unknown persons.

The owner of the inn, Mandol Rene, talked with Lokur and Lux about the information they had obtained through their odd circumstances. He told them what he knew about the legend of the Stormbringer and suggested that they should go and see if a person named Jax was around to find out more. Jax lives on the outer reaches of the Tiger Nomads, outside of town.

Lokur and Lux decided to find out more and let everyone else know what they found out next game. They knew that traveling from Yecha to the keep would take a quarter of a day, but they were determined to uncover the truth about the Stormbringer.

With the new information and the mysterious symbol as their guide, Lux and his companions set off on their journey, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. They knew that their quest would be filled with danger and uncertainty, but they also knew that they had the courage and determination to see it through to the end.
