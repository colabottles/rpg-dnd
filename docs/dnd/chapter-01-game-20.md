# Chapter 1: Game 20

## 9 March 2024

### Zoinks&excl;

The gang was able to go further than they have been and explored most of half of the lower temple level. Ogres and gnolls stood in the way, but when your party is very cautious at every door, it makes for some real psychological fun.

Molly went back for the longsword that turned out to be a blessing and a curse.  Will Molly be able to perform their way out of dropping the sword? WIll Vidya continue the bloodlust after knocking off one of their foes? Does Flint really like using a bow as a dwarf? Is Mikylos secretly hiding a pyro infatuation? What is Mara going to do with that horn?

Find out next week when the gang starts to wonder, "What was in that kitchen and who were those ladies?"
